     <h1 class="first-heading">INSPIRATION</h1>    
        <p class="first-paragraph">The inspiration for songwriting kind of develops naturally for me. My greatest inspiration comes when I take walks in nature. The lyrics just spontaneously come to me so I quickly write them down in phone or book. At first it’s only random bits and pieces. Then I gather them, start structuring it, create a melody around the lyrics, with  piano and loop station. </p>

    <h1 class="second-heading">PROGRESS</h1>
        <p class="second-paragraph">I started playing piano when I was 9 years old. Also, I was in a quire, performed in musicals and eventually started performing.  After highschool I started feeling inspired to write my own songs, instead of performing other people’s pieces. That’s when my creativity really kicked in.</p>
        <p class="second-paragraph-part-two">I remember some of my earlier songs being pretty bad, to say the least. It’s funny to remember them now. I am happy to see that my skills developed over the years and I can say I’m pretty satisfied with how the quality of my songs progressed.</p>

    <h1 class="third-heading">ALTER EGOS</h1>
        <p class="third-paragraph">I love creating the kind of music I like listening to, which is why I have both jazz and alternative pop-rock projects at the moment. And because they are so different from each other it’s almost like I have different alter egos on which band I am performing with.</p>

    <h1 class="fourth-heading">WHAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW</h1>
        <p class="fourth-paragraph">We have to spend a lot of time doing the business part of their career as well. not just be creative. To be honest, it can be pretty exhausting. I’m still learning that and trying to get into sending a lot of emails, making label deals, booking venues etc. But eventually it all pays off because the best part is when I get on the stage and just play with a band. Sharing a moment with them and the crowd is always an amazing feeling.</p>
